# Samples

## Installation
pipenv is broken atm, sorry :/

One command to rule them all: `pipenv install --dev`

## Usage
You want to install vlc as the server is using an api to run the samples with it.
`sudo apt install vlc` on a debian system.

Then 
```bash
pip3 install flask python-vlc
python3 app.py
```
